# Supabench dashboard UI

This is the Supabench dashboard UI (built with Svelte and Vite and based on PocketBase Admin UI).

The used admins avatars are from <https://boringavatars.com/>.

## Development

Download the repo and run the appropriate console commands:

```sh
# install dependencies
npm install

# start a dev server with hot reload at localhost:3000
npm run dev

# or generate production ready bundle in dist/ directory
npm run build
```

## Disclaimer

This is a work in progress mess and is just a cropped version of original PocketBase Admin UI with few things overridden. If you want to take a look on how to write frontend for PocketBase with Svelte and Vite, please check out [the original source code and original documentation](https://pocketbase.io/) on GitHub.
